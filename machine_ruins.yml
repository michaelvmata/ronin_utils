full:
  The machine race does not have parents strictly speaking.  Instead, they are
  born fully formed from the replicator.  This machine looks unlike anything
  you've ever seen before.  It's composed of metals similar to the prototypes,
  but in pattern and shape that is wholly different.  It doesn't appear to be
  able to move from where it sits.  It's body is covered in intricate script
  circles that glow with an unhealthy hew.  Perhaps it's the veins of organic
  matter growing throughout its body.  The replicator has a multitude of
  crimson eyes, all focusing on you.

  The source of the corruption.  The major techno virus assimilates everything
  it touches, subverting it's will, and converting it's being.  It's an
  amorphic being, capable of adapting on the fly to any situation it faces.
  It draws deeply from the surrounding power, using the energy funneled from
  the scripts in the ruins.  Perhaps, that is it’s weakness?

  This fragile looking machine is little more than a couple of legs attached to
  a pair of wings.  It has three eyes that glow crimson red.  Very little can
  escape it's detection.  It swivels back and forth as it's gaze sweeps across
  the area, looking for intruders.

full:
  This hunter killer acts as flying security.  It has four legs with razor
  sharp talons.  It flies in formation with the rest of it’s pack, buzzing
  aggressively towards any perceived intruders.  It has sturdy light armor
  about it's torso, but only has a single eye.  It's sensors are not as good
  as it's two legged cousin, but it packs more of a punch.

short: The buzzer prototype

full:
  The original buzzer, birthed directly from the replicator.  Unlike the buzzers
  you've seen thus far, it's body isn't made from stone and earth.  It appears
  to be composed of metals not of this plane.  The scripts on it's body shine
  brightly.  It's a sleek, killing machine.
